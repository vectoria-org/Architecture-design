In-progress initiative searching the optimal solution for vectoria's incentives to be implemented.
We have different layers to define, which might not share same backbone.

- Corp data layer: it hosts data about products, services and corporations. Initial target is to find for a deceltralized property and platform, and a crowdsourced content.
- User data layer: we understand this layer as centralized, under user control. We are experimenting with a MVP as you can follow in other repositories.
- Business layer: we are transforming business plan into an autonomous smart contract reading basic values from a blockchain. You can contribute vectoria-org#2
- interaction layer: we want our app to be able to connect with a SSO to every layer, no mather the backbone.
- governance layer: it will become decentralized follwowing Roadmap.
- incentives layer: we are creating an autonomoues smart contract that can manage monetary policy vectoria-org/#1
